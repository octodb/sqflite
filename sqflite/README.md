# octodb_sqflite

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/sqflite.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/octodb_sqflite)

OctoDB & SQLite plugin for [Flutter](https://flutter.io).
Supports iOS, Android and MacOS.

* Support transactions and batches
* Helpers for insert/query/update/delete queries
* DB operation executed in a background thread on iOS and Android

Other platforms support:

* Linux/Windows/DartVM support using [sqflite_common_ffi](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite_common_ffi)
* Experimental Web support using [sqflite_common_ffi_web](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite_common_ffi_web).


## Sample Project

* [notepad_sqflite](https://github.com/alextekartik/flutter_app_example/tree/master/notepad_sqflite): Simple flutter notepad working on iOS/Android/Windows/linux/Mac


## Getting Started

To get started, you need to add `octodb_sqflite` to your project. Follow the steps below:

1. Open the terminal in your project root. You can do this by pressing `Alt+F12` in Android Studio or `` Ctrl+` `` in VS Code.

2. Run the following command:

```bash
flutter pub add octodb_sqflite
```

This command will add a line to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file and run an implicit `flutter pub get`. The added line will look like this:

```yaml
dependencies:
  octodb_sqflite:
```

For help getting started with Flutter, view the online [documentation](https://flutter.io/).


## Native Libraries

To install the free version of OctoDB native libraries, execute the following in your project root folder:

```
export FLUTTER_PATH=/path/to/flutter/sdk     # <-- put the path to the Flutter SDK here
echo '----- Android -----'
wget http://octodb.io/download/octodb.aar
mv octodb.aar $FLUTTER_PATH/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dartlang.org/octodb_sqflite-*/android/
echo '-----   iOS   -----'
mkdir octodb && cd octodb
wget http://octodb.io/download/octodb-free-ios-native-libs.tar.gz
tar zxvf octodb-free-ios-native-libs.tar.gz
cd ..
```

When moving to the full version of OctoDB just copy the libraries to the respective folders as done above, replacing the existing files.


## Usage

```dart
import 'package:octodb_sqflite/sqflite.dart';
```

### Opening a Database

A SQLite database is a file in the file system. If no full path is given, the file is saved in the folder obtained by `getDatabasesPath()`, which is the default database directory on Android and the documents directory on iOS/MacOS.

```dart
var uri = 'file:my_db.db?node=secondary&connect=tcp://111.222.33.44:1234'
var db = await openDatabase(uri);
```

Many applications use the database and would never need to close it (it will be closed when the application is
terminated). If you want to release resources, you can close the database:

```dart
await db.close();
```

* See [more information on opening a database](https://github.com/octodb/sqflite/blob/master/sqflite/doc/opening_db.md).


### Database Status

:warning:  The application should **NOT** access the database before it is ready for read and write!

Here is an example block of code using database events:

```dart
db.events(onNotReady: () {
  // the user is not logged in. show the login screen (and do not access the database)
  ...
}, onReady: () {
  // the user is already logged in or the login was successful. show the main screen
  ...
}, onSync: () {
  // the db received an update. update the screen with new data
  ...
});
```

It is also possible to check without events:

```dart
if await db.isReady() {
  ...
}
```

To check the full status of the database we can use:

```dart
var res = await db.rawQuery('PRAGMA sync_status');
print('sync status: ${res}');
```


### User Sign Up & User Login 

When the user is accessing your app for the first time (in any device), it will be required to sign up

The app can capture user data and send it to the backend user authorization service using this command:

```
pragma user_signup='<user_data>'
```

If the user is already signed up on your backend and is now using a new device, it should use the login option:

```
pragma user_login='<user_data>'
```

You can use any user data you want (phone number, username, OAuth...). The data can be encoded in a text (JSON, YAML...)
or a binary format. If using a text format, each single quote must be doubled (replace `'` with `''`).
If using a binary format then it must be encoded in base64 or hex because the command only accepts strings.

Here is an example code using JSON:

```dart
var user = {};
user["email"] = ...
user["password"] = ...
String str = json.encode(user);
str = str.replaceAll("'", "''");
db.execute("pragma user_signup='${str}'");
```

Notice that you must implement the [backend service](https://github.com/octodb/docs/blob/master/auth-service.md)
that handles these authorization requests.


### Multi-User App

To support multiple users in a single app installation your app can have a database for each user.

Your app will need to keep track of which database is used for each user.
An easy way is to convert the username or e-mail into hex format and then use it as the database name:

```dart
var dbname = hex(email) + ".db"
var uri = "file:" + dbname + "?node=secondary&connect=tcp://111.222.33.44:1234"
```

#### Sign Out

Just close the currently open database and display the signup & login screen

#### Login

When the user enters its data (usually e-mail and password):

1. Get the database name based on the e-mail and open it
2. Wait for the db event. If not ready, then send signup/login info via the `pragma` command. If ready, then check if the password is correct


### Raw SQL queries
    
Demo code to perform Raw SQL queries

```dart
// Get a location using getDatabasesPath
var databasesPath = await getDatabasesPath();
String path = join(databasesPath, 'demo.db');
String uri = 'file:' + path + '?node=secondary&connect=tcp://server:port';

// open the database
Database database = await openDatabase(uri);

// --- the code below should be executed after the database is ready for access ---

// Insert some records in a transaction
await database.transaction((txn) async {
  int id1 = await txn.rawInsert(
      'INSERT INTO Test(name, value, num) VALUES("some name", 1234, 456.789)');
  print('inserted1: $id1');
  int id2 = await txn.rawInsert(
      'INSERT INTO Test(name, value, num) VALUES(?, ?, ?)',
      ['another name', 12345678, 3.1416]);
  print('inserted2: $id2');
});

// Update some record
int count = await database.rawUpdate(
    'UPDATE Test SET name = ?, value = ? WHERE name = ?',
    ['updated name', '9876', 'some name']);
print('updated: $count');

// Get the records
List<Map> list = await database.rawQuery('SELECT * FROM Test');
List<Map> expectedList = [
  {'name': 'updated name', 'id': 1, 'value': 9876, 'num': 456.789},
  {'name': 'another name', 'id': 2, 'value': 12345678, 'num': 3.1416}
];
print(list);
print(expectedList);
assert(const DeepCollectionEquality().equals(list, expectedList));

// Count the records
count = Sqflite.firstIntValue(
    await database.rawQuery('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Test'));
assert(count == 2);

// Delete a record
count = await database
    .rawDelete('DELETE FROM Test WHERE name = ?', ['another name']);
assert(count == 1);

// Close the database - only if strictly necessary
//await database.close();
```

Basic information on SQL [here](https://github.com/octodb/sqflite/blob/master/sqflite/doc/sql.md).

### SQL helpers

Example using the helpers

```dart
final String tableTodo = 'todo';
final String columnId = '_id';
final String columnTitle = 'title';
final String columnDone = 'done';

class Todo {
  int id;
  String title;
  bool done;

  Map<String, Object?> toMap() {
    var map = <String, Object?>{
      columnTitle: title,
      columnDone: done == true ? 1 : 0
    };
    if (id != null) {
      map[columnId] = id;
    }
    return map;
  }

  Todo();

  Todo.fromMap(Map<String, Object?> map) {
    id = map[columnId];
    title = map[columnTitle];
    done = map[columnDone] == 1;
  }
}

class TodoProvider {
  Database db;

  Future open(String path) async {
    db = await openDatabase(path);
  }

  Future<Todo> insert(Todo todo) async {
    todo.id = await db.insert(tableTodo, todo.toMap());
    return todo;
  }

  Future<Todo> getTodo(int id) async {
    List<Map> maps = await db.query(tableTodo,
        columns: [columnId, columnDone, columnTitle],
        where: '$columnId = ?',
        whereArgs: [id]);
    if (maps.length > 0) {
      return Todo.fromMap(maps.first);
    }
    return null;
  }

  Future<int> delete(int id) async {
    return await db.delete(tableTodo, where: '$columnId = ?', whereArgs: [id]);
  }

  Future<int> update(Todo todo) async {
    return await db.update(tableTodo, todo.toMap(),
        where: '$columnId = ?', whereArgs: [todo.id]);
  }

  Future close() async => db.close();
}
```

### Read results

Assuming the following read results:

```dart
List<Map<String, Object?>> records = await db.query('my_table');
```

Resulting map items are read-only

```dart
// get the first record
Map<String, Object?> mapRead = records.first;
// Update it in memory...this will throw an exception
mapRead['my_column'] = 1;
// Crash... `mapRead` is read-only
```

You need to create a new map if you want to modify it in memory:

```dart
// get the first record
Map<String, Object?> map = Map<String, Object?>.from(mapRead);
// Update it in memory now
map['my_column'] = 1;
```

### Transactions

:warning: Do not use the database object when inside of a transaction!

Only use the transaction object:

```dart
await database.transaction((txn) async {
  // Ok
  await txn.execute('CREATE TABLE Test1 (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)');
  
  // DON'T  use the database object in a transaction
  // this will deadlock!
  await database.execute('CREATE TABLE Test2 (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)');
});
```

A transaction is committed if the callback does not throw an error. If an error is thrown,
the transaction is cancelled and the same error is re-thrown. So to rollback a transaction one way is to throw an exception.

```dart
try {
   await database.transaction((txn) async {
      await txn.update('TABLE', {'foo': 'bar'});
   });
   // No error, the transaction is committed
} catch (e, st) {
   // this reliably catch if there is a key conflict
   // We know that the transaction is rolled back.
}

try {
  await database.transaction((txn) async {
    // ...
    // cancel the transaction (any error will do)
    throw StateError('cancel transaction');
  });
} catch (e, st) {
  // We know that the transaction is rolled back.
}
```
You can however catch the exception inside the transaction and not rethrow it to commit the transaction. Only the failed statement will not be executed.

```dart
await database.transaction((txn) async {
  // ...
  try {
    await txn.update('TABLE', {'foo': 'bar'});
  } catch (e, st) {
   // this reliably catch if there is a key conflict
   // We know that the transaction is rolled back.
  }
  // ...
  // The transaction will be committed
});
```
### Batch support

To avoid ping-pong between dart and native code, you can use `Batch`:

```dart
batch = db.batch();
batch.insert('Test', {'name': 'item'});
batch.update('Test', {'name': 'new_item'}, where: 'name = ?', whereArgs: ['item']);
batch.delete('Test', where: 'name = ?', whereArgs: ['item']);
results = await batch.commit();
```

Getting the result for each operation has a cost (id for insertion and number of changes for
update and delete), especially on Android where an extra SQL request is executed.
If you don't care about the result and worry about performance in big batches, you can use

```dart
await batch.commit(noResult: true);
```

Warning, during a transaction, the batch won't be committed until the transaction is committed

```dart
await database.transaction((txn) async {
  var batch = txn.batch();
  
  // ...
  
  // commit but the actual commit will happen when the transaction is committed
  // however the data is available in this transaction
  await batch.commit();
  
  //  ...
});
```

By default a batch stops as soon as it encounters an error (which typically reverts the uncommitted changes). You 
can ignore errors so that every successfull operation is ran and committed even if one operation fails:

```dart
await batch.commit(continueOnError: true);
```

## Table and column names

In general it is better to avoid using SQLite keywords for entity names. If any of the following
name is used:

    "add","all","alter","and","as","autoincrement","between","case","check","collate","commit","constraint","create","default","deferrable","delete","distinct","drop","else","escape","except","exists","foreign","from","group","having","if","in","index","insert","intersect","into","is","isnull","join","limit","not","notnull","null","on","or","order","primary","references","select","set","table","then","to","transaction","union","unique","update","using","values","when","where"
    
the helper will *escape* the name i.e.

```dart
db.query('table')
```
will be equivalent to manually adding double-quote around the table name (confusingly here named `table`)

```dart
db.rawQuery('SELECT * FROM "table"');
```

However in any other raw statement (including `orderBy`, `where`, `groupBy`), make sure to escape the name
properly using double quote. For example see below where the column name `group` is not escaped in the columns
argument, but is escaped in the `where` argument.

```dart
db.query('table', columns: ['group'], where: '"group" = ?', whereArgs: ['my_group']);
```

## Supported SQLite types

No validity check is done on values yet so please avoid non supported types [https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html)

`DateTime` is not a supported SQLite type. Personally I store them as 
int (millisSinceEpoch) or string (iso8601)

`bool` is not a supported SQLite type. Use `INTEGER` and 0 and 1 values.

More information on supported types [here](https://github.com/tekartik/sqflite/blob/master/sqflite/doc/supported_types.md).

### INTEGER

* Dart type: `int`
* Supported values: from -2^63 to 2^63 - 1

### REAL

* Dart type: `num`

### TEXT

* Dart type: `String`

### BLOB

* Dart type: `Uint8List`

## Current issues

* Due to the way transaction works in SQLite (threads), concurrent read and write transaction are not supported. 
All calls are currently synchronized and transactions block are exclusive. I thought that a basic way to support 
concurrent access is to open a database multiple times but it only works on iOS as Android reuses the same database object.
I also thought a native thread could be a potential future solution however on android accessing the database in another
thread is blocked while in a transaction...
